# Contributing guidelines
The best way to contribute is to first start with an issue or a discussion, before spending a lot of time creating and testing a Pull Request. It would be a waste of time if the proposed changes do not make sense to the maintainer and we have to reject them.

## Bug reports
For filing bug reports: please include as much information as you can, like relevant environment info (OS, version, screen size), versions of dependencies, way of testing. If you can include a screen recording demoing the issue, please do. You can upload them straight into the issue text by dragging and dropping the fiel, where it will be hosted for free.
